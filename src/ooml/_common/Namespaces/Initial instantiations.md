The `ooml-instantiate` tag is requried because, while declaring a bunch of classes is nice, something needs to be executed. In almost every language and program, this is done by creating a new instance of a "main class" and/or running some function immediately. Similarly, in ooml, some class is chosen to be instantiated immediately after parsing all the classes. The code to ignite the app is then written in this class's constructor. These are known as [initial instantiations](#Initial instantiations).
