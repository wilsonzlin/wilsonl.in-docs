ooml is designed to have a "gradual learning curve" â€” that is, it's designed to allow beginners to start developing serious apps very quickly, only requiring them to learn the rest when necessary.

This is possible because the fundamental concepts and techniques of ooml are based on popular and well-known concepts like object orientation, JSON, and HTML templating.

ooml is also designed to be incredibly easy to set up and develop in. It is very declarative, and only requires one small file, which can be loaded via a `<script>` tag. It takes just one line to bootstrap an entire app.

Also, interacting with ooml is designed to be almost identical to vanilla JavaScript. This makes the code intuitive and easy to understand, and look like regular JavaScript logic.

Finally, ooml is designed to mirror the server's state. Initialising an app with previous state is incredibly easy, and so is serialising the state to send to the server, thanks to the strong JSON-like structure of classes. This makes it possible to model the UI around the data, allowing the user to interact and manipulate it, and sync with the server seamlessly.
