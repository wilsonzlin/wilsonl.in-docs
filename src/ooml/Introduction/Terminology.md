Many terms used when talking about ooml can be confusing, due to the nature of how ooml is implemented and used.

ooml has classes, and uses terminology like **instances**, **instantiation**, **construction**, **constructor**, **methods**, and **properties**. But ooml is also involved in a lot of JavaScript, which also uses the same terms.

Similarly, ooml has views, which involves HTML and DOM terminology. But ooml is also declared in HTML and utilises the DOM APIs, which means that the terms can mean something different, depending on the context.

Finally, the two main classes used in ooml are **OOML.Instance** and **OOML.Array**, which emulate the **object** and **array** data structures in JavaScript, but are not the same thing. Objects are already ambiguous in JavaScript (literal, JSON, type, direct descendant), so this also needs clarification.

This article tries to list and describe all potentially confusing terminology.
