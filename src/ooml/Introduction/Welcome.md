Welcome to the documentation for ooml!

The documentation is laid out into categories.

For a quick start into ooml development, read the *Introduction* and *Fundamentals* categories. They will explain most of the concepts and techniques required to develop even large-scale web apps.

For people who want to learn more about the advanced, nuanced parts of ooml, reading the articles in any of the other categories, not necessarily in order, will be useful.

If you notice a mistake or have comments, please send them using the feedback tool, accessible in the menu exposed by the button in the top right.
