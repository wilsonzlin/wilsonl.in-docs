The data to send. Omit or provide something falsy to send nothing.

- If the data is an instance of `FormData`, it will be passed straight through to the underlying `XMLHttpRequest` instance and not touched.
- If the method is not `POST` and a plain object is provided, it will be serialised into a query string and appended to the URL prefixed with a question mark (?), *even if the URL already has a query string*.
- If a plain object is provided and the method is `POST`, it will be serialised into the content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and the `Content-Type` header will be set.
