The name of the property with an exclamation mark prefix.
Change the value of each element's property value depending on the current value of the property.

- If the value is a boolean, set it to `!currentValue` (the opposite value).
- If the value is a string, set it to `""` (an empty string).
- If the value is of type `"object"` (`typeof currentValue == "object"`), set it to `null`.
- If the value is anything else, leave the value as it is.
