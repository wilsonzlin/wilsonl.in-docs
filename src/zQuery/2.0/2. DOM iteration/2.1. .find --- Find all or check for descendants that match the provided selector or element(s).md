someDescendantsMatch = zq.find( string selectorWithQuestion )

# Arguments

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|comparison|The selector or element(s) to compare descendants to. If it's an array-like or zQuery object, only one element in the object must match for it to count as a match.|
|selectorWithExclamation|A string that contains a selector and the exclamation mark (!) as its first character. This checks if all descendants match the selector.|
|selectorWithQuestion|A string that contains a selector and the question mark (?) as its first character. This checks if at least one descendant matches the selector.|

# Returns

- A new zQuery instance containing the matching descendants
- A boolean that is `true` if all/some descendants match and `false` otherwise
