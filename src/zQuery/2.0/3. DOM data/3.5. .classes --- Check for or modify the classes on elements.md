allElemsHaveAllClasses = zq.classes( string spaceSeparatedClassesWithAsterisk )

# Arguments

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|spaceSeparatedClassesWithAsterisk|A string that contains space-separated classes and the asterisk (&ast;) as its first character (e.g. `"*class1 class2"`). This checks if all elements in the current instance have all the classes.
<br>
*If any class has a dot (.) as its first character, the dot will be ignored.*|
|spaceSeparatedClasses|A string that contains space-separated classes.
<br>
*If any class has a dot (.) as its first character, the dot will be ignored.*|
|classes|An array containing classes stored as strings.
<br>
*If any class has a dot (.) as its first character, the dot will be ignored.*|
|addOrRemove|If `true`, the classes will be added to each element in the current instance. If `false`, the classes will be removed from each element in the current instance.|

# Returns

- The current zQuery instance
- A boolean that is `true` if all/some elements in the current instance have all of the classes and `false` otherwise
