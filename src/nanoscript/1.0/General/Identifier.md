Throughout the documentation, if an **identifier** is required, it is requiring a sequence of characters that:

- only contains alphabetical characters, digits, and the following characters: `_` `$`
- is not a [reserved keyword](#Keyword)
- does not start with a digit, and
- does not start with three underscores (`___`).
