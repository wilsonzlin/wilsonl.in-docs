**Literals** are expressions and are literal representations of values in source code:

- Boolean (`true` and `false`)
- Null (`null`)
- Number (see [Number](#Number value))
- String (see [String](#String value))
- List (see [List](#List value))
- Map (see [Map](#Map value))
- Object (see [Object](#Object value), specifically **anonymous objects**)
- Callable (see [Callable](#Lambda))

Iterators do not have a literal representation, and classes are declared using statements, not expressions.
