**Literals** are expressions and are literal representations of values in source code:

- Boolean (`true` and `false`)
- Null (`null`)
- Number (see [l art="#Number value": Number])
- String (see [l art="#String value": String])
- List (see [l art="#List value": List])
- Map (see [l art="#Map value": Map])
- Object (see [l art="#Object value": Object], specifically **anonymous objects**)
- Callable (see [l art="#Lambda": Callable])

Iterators do not have a literal representation, and classes are declared using statements, not expressions.
