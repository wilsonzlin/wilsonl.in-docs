There are two types of members:

- **Member variables**: Variables attached to the value that have their own value independent of any other value, including ones with the same type. They are normally accessed and assigned to.
- **Member functions**: Functions that implicitly take in the value as a parameter and does something invoving it. They are normally accessed and called simultaneously.

Members can be used using the [l art="#Access": access] operators.

All values except objects and classes have predefined **members**. These definitions can be found in their respective [l art="#Core type": core type] documentation article. Objects and classes define their own member [l art="#Class variable": variables] and [l art="#Class function": functions].
