There are several core value types in nanoscript. These are:

- [l art="#Boolean value": Boolean]
- [l art="#Callable value": Callable]
- [l art="#Class value": Class]
- [l art="#Iterator value": Iterator]
- [l art="#List value": List]
- [l art="#Map value": Map]
- [l art="#Null value": Null]
- [l art="#Number value": Number]
- [l art="#Object value": Object]
- [l art="#String value": String]

These are the core types in nanoscript. Every value is one of these types, but can also be other types due to object orientation; see [l art="#Type hierarchy": Type hierarchy].

Most values can be represented [l art="#Literal": literally] in source code. Almost all have predefined [l art="#Operation": operations] and [l art="#Member": members] depending on their type.
