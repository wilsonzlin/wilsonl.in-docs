# Literals

Maps can be declared literally by separating each entry with a comma and adding curly braces to the ends. Each entry is declared in the form `key as value`, where `key` and `value` are valid expressions. Some examples:

|Code|Size|Entries|
|---|
|`{}`|0||
|``{`stringkey` as `stringvalue`}``|1|<table><thead><tr><th>Key<th>Value</thead><tbody><tr><th>`` `stringkey` ``<td>`` `stringvalue` ``</table>|
|<pre>{<br>  &#96;pi&#96; as 3.14,<br>  &#96;Math.PI&#96; as pi,<br>  42 as true,<br>  {} as {},<br>  &#96;a list&#96; as \[1, 2, &#96;three&#96;, four\] <br>}</pre>|5|<table><thead><tr><th>Key<th>Value</thead><tbody><tr><th>`` `pi` ``<td>`3.14`<tr><th>`Math.PI`<td>`` `pi` ``<tr><th>`42`<td>`true`<tr><th>`{}`<td>`{}`<tr><th>`` `a list` ``<td>``[1, 2, `three`, four]``</table>|

Map keys and values can be of any type, and do not have to be the same. Maps do not have to have the same types of keys or values.

# Operations

## Test emptyness

Gives `true` if it has no entries, and `false` otherwise.
