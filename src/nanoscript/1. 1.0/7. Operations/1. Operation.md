All values have **operations** that can be executed on them. These include:

|Operation|Parameters|Result value type|Description|
|---|
|Access|Member|Any|Access a member of value|
|Assign to|Member, Value||Assign value to a member of value|
|Look up|Terms|Any|Look up provided terms in value|
|Update|Terms|Any|Update associated value of terms in value|
|Call|Arguments|Any|Call value with provided arguments|
|Measure||Any|Measure value|
|Exponentiate|Other value|Any|Exponentiate value by other value|
|Multiply|Other value|Any|Multiply value by other value|
|Divide|Other value|Any|Divide value by other value|
|Modulo|Other value|Any|Modulo value by other value|
|Add|Other value|Any|Add other value to value|
|Subtract|Other value|Any|Subtract other value from value|
|Check contents|Value|Boolean|Check if value contains value|
|Test emptyness||Boolean|Check if value is empty|
|Test identity|Other value|Boolean|Check if value and other value refer to the same value|
|Test equality|Other value|Boolean|Test if value is equal to other value|
|Compare|Other value|Number|Compare value to other value|
|Test ancestry|Type|Boolean|Check if value is a descendant of a type|
|Iterate||Iterator|Provide an iterator|
|Represent||String|Convert value to a string value|
|Serialise||Any|Represent value as a primitive or serialisable value|

All [l art="#Core type": values except objects] implement some or all of these operations according to the official specifications, and their implementation cannot be changed. Objects [l art="#Object operation implementation": define their own] implementations of operations.

Operations are executed with operation expressions and involves an [l art="#Operator": operator] and one or more operands. For example:

```nanoscript
create a as 1 + 2
set a to `hello` + `world`
a * 2
```

In the above example, `1 + 2`, `` `hello` + `world` ``, and `a * 2` are all operation expressions.

Attempting to use an operator on values that it doesn't support will cause an `UnsupportedOperationError`.
