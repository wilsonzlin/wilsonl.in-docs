The largest unit of source code in nanoscript is the **chunk**. A chunk is simply a sequence of statements and any comments in raw source code (i.e. text) form. The interpreter goes character by character, parsing any valid code into [l art="#Expression": expressions] and [l art="#Statement": statements] and evaluating them, while ignoring comments.

This "sequence of statements" can be from anywhere -- it's not relevant to the interpreter. It could be a whole or part of a file on a disk, the text in a text control in a GUI app, or the stream of characters being typed into a live interpreter running in a terminal session.

Example of a chunk of code, stored in a file called *hello-world.ns*:

```nanoscript
print("Hello world")
```

A chunk has its own [l art="#Scope": scope]. Even when used as a module, a chunk's variables are only visible to code within the chunk, and cannot be accessed or modified anywhere else. [l art="#Exporting": Exports] can be used to share state and functionality outside the chunk as a [l art="#Module": module].

Only at the chunk level can there be [l art="#Importing": `import`], [l art="#Exporting": `export`], and [l art="#User-defined class": `class`] declarations.
