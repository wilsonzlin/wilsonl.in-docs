nanoscript is designed to be simple to learn, simple to prototype, simple to scale, and simple to extend.

nanoscript is a scripting language, which makes it really simple to write small single-purpose code, quickly test or run some logic, and prototype ideas rapidly. However, it can also scale quickly, and is designed to transition to and handle large projects and lots of intermingled code:

- [Modules](#Modules) allows decoupling and encapsulating code, breaking them down into organised, manageable chunks of code.
- The type system can go from no typing, to type hinting, to strong type enforcement at compile-time, with just a few switches.
- Object orientation and first-class functions are available to provide different paradigms for large-scale projects.
- Native code can be used with nanoscript for raw performance and much greater flexibility.
