There are several data types in nanoscript. These are:

- [Boolean](#Boolean)
- [Callable](#Callable)
- [Class](#Class)
- [Iterator](#Iterator)
- [List](#List)
- [Map](#Map)
- [Null](#Null)
- [Number](#Number)
- [Object](#Object)
- [String](#String)

These are the core types in nanoscript. Every data is one of these types, but can also be other types due to object orientation; see [Type hierarchy](#Type hierarchy).

Most data types can be represented [literally](#Literal) in source code. Almost all have predefined [operations](#Operation) and [members](#Member) that allow use of their data.
