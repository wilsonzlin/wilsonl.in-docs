# Literals

Lists can be declared literally by separating each element with a comma and adding square brackets to the ends. Some examples:

|Code|Length|Elements|
|---|---|---|
|`[]`|0||
|`[1]`|1|`1`|
|``[3.14, Math.PI, true, {}, [1, 2, `three`, four]]``|5|`3.14`, `Math.PI`, `true`, `{}`, ``[1, 2, `three`, four]``|

Lists can hold any data type, and do not require all elements to be the same type. Lists can hold lists, allowing multi-dimensional and nested lists.
