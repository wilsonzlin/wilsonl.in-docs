There are several core value types in nanoscript. These are:

- [Boolean](#Boolean value)
- [Callable](#Callable value)
- [Class](#Class value)
- [Iterator](#Iterator value)
- [List](#List value)
- [Map](#Map value)
- [Null](#Null value)
- [Number](#Number value)
- [Object](#Object value)
- [String](#String value)

These are the core types in nanoscript. Every value is one of these types, but can also be other types due to object orientation; see [Type hierarchy](#Type hierarchy).

Most values can be represented [literally](#Literal) in source code. Almost all have predefined [operations](#Operation) and [members](#Member) depending on their type.
