**Classes** are fundamental to object orientated languages. They describe a type, its associated functionality, and what data it holds.

To use them, objects of its type are constructed according to the class's constructor. That object holds data in its member variables.

The class defines what the object's variables are, but each object has their own independent value.

The class defines special functions that can access the object's variables.

The class can also define what happens when objects of its type are used as part of an operation, as well as when something tries to access or assign to non-existent member variables of the object.
